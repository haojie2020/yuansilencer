A dual-function cis-regulatory element (“ESpromoter”) can act as both enhancer and silencer to tune ATP2B4 and LAX1 in human T cells; its allele-specific interaction with rs11240391 helps explain severe malaria risk.

## Abstract (concise summary)

The authors identify an **enhancer–silencer promoter (ESpromoter)** that **activates ATP2B4** yet **represses LAX1** in single human T cells. Using integrative genomics,
CRISPR perturbations, reporter assays, and cohort genetics, they show an **epistatic interaction** between five ESpromoter SNPs and **rs11240391** in the LAX1 promoter.
This allele-specific interaction reduces **LAX1** expression and associates with **severe malaria** susceptibility, challenging the classic enhancer–silencer dichotomy.

## Key takeaways

- **Dual-function regulatory DNA**: one element can enhance one gene (ATP2B4) while silencing another (LAX1) within the same cell context.
- **Mechanistic link**: the LAX1 promoter variant **rs11240391** (FOS::JUN binding site) modifies the repression strength exerted by the ESpromoter.
- **Evidence stack**: chromatin interaction maps, CRISPR deletions, RT-qPCR, luciferase reporters, and human cohort genetics support the model.
- **Disease relevance**: allele-specific regulation contributes to **severe malaria** risk via **T-cell activation** pathways.
