Loss of this element—through upstream deletions or tandem duplications—drives overexpression and explains the tissue‑specific pathology of autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD).\nAbstract (concise summary) Investigating families with LMNB1 tandem duplications that surprisingly do not show demyelination, alongside ADLD tissues, CRISPR‑edited cell lines, and mouse models, the authors identify an oligodendrocyte‑specific silencer. This element contains CTCF sites that form 3D chromatin loops and recruit PRC2, reducing LMNB1 transcription in oligodendrocytes. Loss of the silencer (by upstream deletion) or functional uncoupling (with certain duplications) elevates LMNB1 expression and underpins ADLD’s cell‑type specificity and pathogenesis.\nKey takeaways Mechanism: CTCF‑anchored looping plus PRC2‑mediated repression keeps LMNB1 low in oligodendrocytes; removing the element lifts repression. Evidence: Multi‑family human genetics, ATAC/ChIP, CRISPR editing, reporter assays, RNA/protein readouts, and mouse models converge on the same mechanism. Clinical lens: Explains why LMNB1 dosage changes cause CNS‑restricted demyelination, despite broad LMNB1 expression. Therapeutic angle: Restoring the silencer’s function (synthetic silencers/insulators, epigenetic targeting) could normalize LMNB1 in ADLD.

Genetic/biochemical disruption of this interaction restores tapasin and boosts HLA‑I surface levels—implicating hnRNP C as a biomarker and target for T‑cell–based immunotherapy.\nAbstract (concise, paraphrased) The study identifies hnRNP C as an RNA‑binding protein that recognizes a silencer motif within the TAPBP (tapasin) 3′UTR in melanoma. By binding this site, hnRNP C decreases tapasin expression and limits HLA class I antigen processing and presentation. Across cell models and patient‑derived materials, loss or inhibition of hnRNP C increases TAPBP mRNA/protein and elevates HLA‑I at the cell surface. These findings position hnRNP C as a regulator of tumor immune visibility and a potential therapeutic/diagnostic handle.\nKey takeaways Mechanism: hnRNP C engages a 3′UTR silencer in TAPBP, dampening antigen processing and HLA‑I display. Evidence: RNA‑protein assays, reporter constructs, perturbation genetics, and analyses of melanoma samples converge on the model. Impact: Relieving this repression could enhance T‑cell recognition, offering a route to improve immunotherapy responsiveness. Suggested citation Wang Y, Lazaridou M‑F, Kordaß T, et al.

Disrupting this element boosts HTLV‑1 expression and immunogenicity; inserting it into HIV‑1 suppresses production—revealing a portable, cis‑acting latency switch.\nAbstract (concise summary) The study maps an open chromatin region inside the HTLV‑1 provirus that functions as a silencer of the 5′‑LTR. The element binds RUNX1/CBFβ, limits transcriptional bursts and antigen expression, and thereby supports viral persistence. CRISPR mutagenesis and reporter assays show that removing the element elevates viral transcripts and replication, while heterologous insertion into HIV‑1 diminishes virion output. These results uncover a host‑factor‑tethered intragenic latency module with therapeutic implications for retroviral control.\nKey takeaways Mechanism: RUNX complex binding to an intragenic silencer represses HTLV‑1 sense transcription and stabilizes latency. Portability: The element is sufficient to suppress HIV‑1 production when transplanted into the HIV‑1 genome. Methods: ATAC‑seq, luciferase reporters, CRISPR editing, qPCR/ddPCR, ChIP‑PCR, flow cytometry and patient PBMC analyses. Why it matters: Identifies a discrete, druggable node for latency control that could inform antivirals or vaccine‑adjuvant strategies. Suggested citation Sugata K, Rahman A, Niimura K, et al.

Using integrative genomics, CRISPR perturbations, reporter assays, and cohort genetics, they show an epistatic interaction between five ESpromoter SNPs and rs11240391 in the LAX1 promoter. This allele-specific interaction reduces LAX1 expression and associates with severe malaria susceptibility, challenging the classic enhancer–silencer dichotomy.\nKey takeaways Dual-function regulatory DNA: one element can enhance one gene (ATP2B4) while silencing another (LAX1) within the same cell context. Mechanistic link: the LAX1 promoter variant rs11240391 (FOS::JUN binding site) modifies the repression strength exerted by the ESpromoter. Evidence stack: chromatin interaction maps, CRISPR deletions, RT-qPCR, luciferase reporters, and human cohort genetics support the model.
