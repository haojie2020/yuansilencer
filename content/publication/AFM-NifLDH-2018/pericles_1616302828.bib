abstract = {Abstract 3D hierarchical heterostructure NiFe LDH@NiCoP/NF electrodes are prepared successfully on nickel foam with special interface engineering and synergistic effects. This research finds that the as-prepared NiFe LDH@NiCoP/NF electrodes have a more sophisticated inner structure and intensive interface than a simple physical mixture. The NiFe LDH@NiCoP/NF electrodes require an overpotential as low as 120 and 220 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 m KOH, respectively. Tafel and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further reveal a favorable kinetic during electrolysis. Specifically, the NiFe LDH@NiCoP/NF electrodes are simultaneously used as cathode and anode for overall water splitting, which requires a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the heterostructure improves the structural stability and promotes the generation of active phases during HER and OER, resulting in excellent stability over 100 h of continuous operation. Moreover, the strategy and interface engineering of the introduced heterostructure can also be used to prepare other bifunctional and cost-efficient electrocatalysts for various applications.},
