Melanoma cells exploit **hnRNP C** to bind a repressive site in **tapasin (TAPBP)** 3′UTR, lowering HLA‑I antigen presentation. Genetic/biochemical disruption of this interaction restores tapasin and boosts HLA‑I surface levels—implicating hnRNP C as a biomarker and target for T‑cell–based immunotherapy.

## Abstract (concise, paraphrased)

The study identifies **hnRNP C** as an RNA‑binding protein that recognizes a **silencer motif** within the **TAPBP (tapasin)** 3′UTR in melanoma.
By binding this site, hnRNP C decreases tapasin expression and limits **HLA class I** antigen processing and presentation.
Across cell models and patient‑derived materials, loss or inhibition of hnRNP C increases **TAPBP mRNA/protein** and elevates **HLA‑I** at the cell surface.
These findings position hnRNP C as a regulator of tumor immune visibility and a potential **therapeutic/diagnostic handle**.

## Key takeaways

- **Mechanism**: hnRNP C engages a **3′UTR silencer** in *TAPBP*, dampening antigen processing and **HLA‑I** display.
- **Evidence**: RNA‑protein assays, reporter constructs, perturbation genetics, and analyses of melanoma samples converge on the model.
- **Impact**: Relieving this repression could enhance **T‑cell recognition**, offering a route to improve immunotherapy responsiveness.
