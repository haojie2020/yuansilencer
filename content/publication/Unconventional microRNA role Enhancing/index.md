# Summary and abstract
summary: "miR-155-5p disrupts a silencer motif in tapasin (TPN/TAPBP) 3′UTR to elevate HLA-I antigen processing and cell-surface expression."
abstract: |
  This study reports an unconventional, **silencer-interacting** role of **miR‑155‑5p** in tumor cells. By binding a repressive site within the
  *tapasin* (TAPBP) 3′UTR, miR‑155‑5p weakens silencer activity, increasing tapasin levels, stabilizing peptide loading of **HLA‑I**, and boosting
  HLA‑I surface expression. CRISPR edits, luciferase reporters, qPCR/Western blots, and flow cytometry support the mechanism; analyses of public
  melanoma cohorts relate miR‑155/TPN status to immune infiltration and outcome. Functionally, higher HLA‑I correlates with reduced NK degranulation
  toward target cells, consistent with restored antigen presentation and altered immune interactions.
